# RSA-Encryption-Attacks
This is a Java based program that performs two different attacks on RSA.

This program performs the following attacks:

  1) Pollards p-1 attack
  2) Continued Fraction attack
  
Both of these attacks, given a public key, will yield the private key for relatively small D's.
